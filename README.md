# 🌐 CEA Web

## 🧭 Overview
**CEA Web** is a Windows-based full-screen presentation platform developed in **Visual Basic** using **Visual Studio** for the directors of AHMSA. It complements the CEA Windows app by offering a clean, minimalistic interface to display approved high-value purchase cases during weekly committee sessions.

Developed specifically for Mac users in the general direction, CEA Web allows presenters to showcase each case slide-by-slide in an automated, branded layout designed for clarity and professionalism.

## 💡 Idea & Concept
CEA Web was built to:
- Provide a simplified viewing experience on director-provided MacBooks
- Replace PowerPoint slides manually generated each week
- Connect directly to the **[CEA](https://github.com/HermiloOrtega/CEA)** database for real-time, accurate case access
- Deliver a seamless "presentation mode" for use on large screens during weekly procurement reviews

## ✨ Features & Functionality
- 🖥 Presentation Mode:
  - Full-screen display mimicking a PowerPoint experience
  - Automatic slide navigation by case
  - Dedicated view per title, details, and pricing table image
- 🔍 Review Cases:
  - Load only approved and validated cases for committee review
- 📚 Case Details:
  - Vendor info, justification, contract reference, session number, etc.
- 🗃 Archive Access:
  - Browse previously approved or postponed cases
- 🔧 Simple interface for navigation and next/previous control
- ⚙️ Offline Compatibility:
  - Designed to match **[CEA Offline](https://github.com/HermiloOrtega/CEA-Offline)** layout and logic for consistency
